<h2>Welcome To York Free Fencers Guild</h2>

<p>We start 2017 by saying goodbye to the Melbourne Centre, which has been our
home since May 2012. &nbsp;The Centre has been a good place to train and for
various events, but we have outgrown it and it was time to move on. &nbsp;We
have moved to the York Steiner School where we will be training in the school's
gymnasium which is approaching twice the size of  the hall used in the
Melbourne Centre and makes the use of staff and pole arms possible. &nbsp;This
is all very exciting and we look forward to seeing everyone for even better
training sessions this year!</p>
<!--
<img src="images/melbourne_centre-a.jpg" height="" width="100%" alt="pic of the Melbourne Centre." />
-->

<p>Our training sessions take place on a Wednesday evening at the York Steiner
School, Danesmead, Fulford Cross, Fulford, York, YO10 4PB. &nbsp;Please note
the school has a strict policy of no outdoor shoes in the gym, so please make
sure you have appropriate footware. &nbsp;Thankyou!</p>

<p>Usual start time is 2000hrs and runs for two hours till 2200hrs.  &nbsp;To
start you will need loose fitting sports clothing, preferably dark in colour, a
drink to re-hydrate yourself and maybe a towel and change of top if you wish to
head to the pub after for the post training discussions and generally
socialise.</p>

<p>Your first training session is free, after that a charge of &pound;5 is made
to cover the cost of hiring the hall with any funds left over going to buying
club kit to help newcomers get started.  &nbsp;Regulars to our training
sessions can pay &pound;20 for a month, due on the first session of the
month. &nbsp;An annual fee of &pound;25 is payable to the British Federation of
Historical Swordplay and this gives you insurance cover for HEMA
activities.</p>

<p>We usually end each training session with 15-20 mins of freeplay to allow
the techniques learnt during the evening to be put into practice.  The last
Wednesday of the month is a free evening, you'll still have to pay, but you can
choose to look at a particular technique, or another weapon or spar with like
minded students, it's up to you.</p>

<p>New students regularly ask for the names of suppliers of kit, Payson has
created this .pdf to answer this. Accurate at the end of March 2017 
<a href="hema-gear-2017.pdf">Hema Gear Suppliers</a>.</p>


<p>Last year we introduced the chance for some of our more experienced students
to take either part or whole sessions to pass on those areas of our art that
they are most interested in to the Guild. &nbsp;We also have guests coming to
offer instruction occasionally.  &nbsp;Details of who and what they intend to
teach available below:</p>
